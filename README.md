<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About DocFX Unity Package Action

This is a gitHub action for deploying a DocFX website for Unity packages to Github Pages. These days, Unity maintains a lot of [optional packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/pack-safe.html) containing [great documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.9/manual/). This action aims to allow you to easily build documentation for Unity packages!

If your repository is already a Unity package, all you need to do follow the [installation guide](#installation)!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section lays out how to get started with DocFX Unity Package Action.

### Prerequisites

Your repository should be a [Unity Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html).

Specifically, the root of your project should contain:
- `package.json`
- `Changelog.md`
- `License.md`
-  either `README.md` or `Documentation~/index.md`

### Installation

1. In the github of your unity package, create a branch called "gh-pages" (the naming matters!).
2. Go to the Settings tab, select "Pages" in the table on the left, then select "Deploy from a Branch" and select "gh-pages" as the branch to deploy from.
3. Go to the Actions tab, then select "set up a workflow yourself" and find "docfx-unitypackage" in the marketplace.

*Example of the correct settings for step 2*

Every time you push to main, this action will run and your site will get automatically updated with any documentation or api changes!
