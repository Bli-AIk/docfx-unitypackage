<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About DocFX Unity Package Action

This is a gitHub action for deploying a DocFX website for Unity packages to Github Pages. These days, Unity maintains a lot of [optional packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/pack-safe.html) containing [great documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.9/manual/). This action's goal is to allow you to easily build documentation for Unity packages published on github. It aims to mimic [Unity's documentation workflow][workflow-url] while keeping the native benefits of [DocFX][docfx-url].



<!-- Installation -->
## Installation

1. In the github of your unity package, create a branch called "gh-pages" (the naming matters!).
2. Go to the Settings tab, select "Pages" in the table on the left, then select "Deploy from a Branch" and select "gh-pages" as the branch to deploy from.
3. Go to the Actions tab, then select "set up a workflow yourself" and find "docfx-unitypackage" in the marketplace.

Every time you push to main, this action will run and your site will get automatically updated with any documentation or api changes!

### Prerequisites

Your repository should be a [Unity Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html).

Specifically, the root of your project should contain:
- `package.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md` [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- either `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`
- either `README.md` or `Documentation~/index.md`



<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

The DocFX Unity Package Action has been specifically designed to mimic the affordances and limitations of the [Package Manager DocTools@2.1][workflow-url]. In theory, you should be able to use the documentation of the version 2.1 tools and everything should work exactly the same, except for the following differences:
- DocFX Unity Package Action is forgiving to beginners. All that is required by the [Package Manager DocTools@2.1][workflow-url] is recommended, but optional.
- To add a custom logo and favicon to the generated website, add a file called `logo` and `favicon` inside the `Documentation~/images/` folder. The recommended logo height is 50px.
- When you don't have a `TableOfContents.md` in your `Documentation~`, the manual will be created without a table of contents. This may be preferrable for single-page documentation.
- [Unity's per-package metadata](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-doctools@2.1/manual/package-metadata.html), the values you can override in `projectMetadata.json`, are different from [DocFX's per-package metadata](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/docs/template.html?tabs=modern#template-metadata).

If there are any other changes not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CaseyHofland/docfx-unitypackage/issues) to propose it be added to the docs.
